# Pathfinding-w-Genetic-Algorithm

I created this project using Processing (basically the Java version of Arduino) to implement the Genetic Algorithm to "teach" artificial entities how to pathfind on their own. Credit goes to Code Bullet's videos as he taught me what the Genetic Algorithm was and how it works. You can view the first part of his series here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnwjxityDLQ.
